# Implementation Plan: Canonical Emotion Registry

**Date**: 2026-02-27
**Status**: Complete (all 7 phases)
**Supersedes**: IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md Multi-Tree section (now part of Phase 5)

## Problem

Each emotion is defined in full (id, label, description, needs, color) in every model that uses it. The same concept gets duplicated with inconsistent descriptions. Adding emotions means editing multiple files. Crisis detection hardcodes IDs disconnected from emotion data. Wheel uses ID suffixes (`helpless_fear`, `helpless_sad`) to fake multi-parent belonging.

## Solution

One canonical catalog (`src/models/catalog/`). Models reference by ID and add only model-specific metadata. Suffix duplicates collapse into single entries with multiple parents.

## Architecture

```
                    catalog/*.json
                         |
                    catalog/index.ts
                   /    |     |     \
            Plutchik  Wheel  Dimen  Somatic     QuickCheckIn  distress.ts
            index.ts  index  index  index.ts    (direct)      (direct)
               |       |      |       |
          Hydrated allEmotions (PlutchikEmotion, WheelEmotion, etc.)
               |       |      |       |
          EmotionModel.allEmotions ← unchanged interface
               |
          All existing UI + hooks unchanged
```

BaseEmotion and EmotionModel interfaces unchanged. The catalog is an internal assembly detail.

## Non-Obvious Decisions

- **Plutchik "joy" ≠ Wheel "happy" ≠ Dimensional "happy"**: Different theoretical constructs → separate canonical entries. Only emotions with the SAME ID and SAME psychological construct share a canonical entry.
- **Model colors override canonical color**: Each model's color scheme serves its visualization. The canonical color is only used in cross-model contexts (Quick Check-in, session history).
- **Somatic `contextDescription`**: Body-region-specific framing stays in somatic data files. Not duplication — it's genuinely different from the canonical description.
- **Wheel `parents: string[]`** replaces `parent: string`. Drill-down tracks navigation path in `ModelState.custom.navPath` to show correct breadcrumbs.
- **`distressTier` on canonical entries**: `'high'` replaces hardcoded `HIGH_DISTRESS_IDS`. `TIER3_COMBOS`/`TIER4_COMBOS` stay as explicit config (combination risk is clinical judgment, not an individual property).

## Phases

1. Catalog foundation (additive, zero risk)
2. Quick Check-in + distress migration
3. Dimensional model → overlays
4. Plutchik model → overlays
5. Wheel model → overlays + multi-parent + suffix dedup
6. Somatic model → signal refactoring
7. Docs (non-obvious things only)

## Conflicts & Future Work

- Wheel breadcrumb ambiguity with multi-parent → track navPath
- Canonical color choice → pick most visually distinctive for cross-model use
- `SomaticRegion extends BaseEmotion` semantic mismatch → not worth fixing for 4 models
- Cross-model session insights ("anger via body + wheel this week") → enabled by canonical IDs, not built yet
