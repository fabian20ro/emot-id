# Iteration Log

> Append-only journal of AI agent work sessions on this project.
> **Add an entry at the end of every iteration.**
> When patterns emerge (same issue 2+ times), promote to `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`.

## Format

Each entry should follow this structure:

---

### [YYYY-MM-DD] Brief Description of Work Done

**Context:** What was the goal / what triggered this work
**What happened:** Key actions taken, decisions made
**Outcome:** Result — success, partial, or failure
**Insight:** (optional) What would you tell the next agent about this?
**Promoted to Lessons Learned:** Yes/No

### [2026-02-17] Update dependencies to latest versions

**Context:** Branch `claude/update-dependencies-1g80E` — update all project dependencies to current versions.
**What happened:**
- Ran `npm update` for semver-compatible bumps (framer-motion 12.29->12.34, @vitejs/plugin-react 5.1.2->5.1.4, @playwright/test 1.58.1->1.58.2, @types/react 19.2.10->19.2.14, typescript-eslint 8.54->8.56).
- Installed major version bumps: `@types/node` ^24->^25, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` ^0.4->^0.5, `globals` ^16->^17, `jsdom` ^27->^28.
- Attempted ESLint 9->10 and @eslint/js 9->10 but hit `ERESOLVE` peer dependency conflict with `typescript-eslint` (requires eslint ^8.57 or ^9). Skipped.
- Verified: build passes, all 366 tests pass (49 files), lint errors unchanged (39 pre-existing, not regressions), 0 npm audit vulnerabilities (was 1 high before update).
**Outcome:** Success. All non-blocked dependencies updated. ESLint 10 deferred.
**Insight:** Always check `npm outdated` to distinguish semver-compatible from major bumps. Attempt major bumps together but be ready to back off individual packages on peer conflicts. Verify lint error count before and after to confirm no regressions.
**Promoted to Lessons Learned:** Yes (ESLint 10 constraint, npm outdated workflow)

### [2026-02-17] Migrate memory system to two-file format

**Context:** Replaced the observational-memory single-file system (`LESSONS_LEARNED.md` with raw incident buffer, observation log, and reflector cycle) with a two-file system: curated `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` + append-only `ITERATION_LOG.md`.
**What happened:**
- Migrated 11 existing observations from the old format into categorized sections (Architecture, Code Patterns, Testing, Performance, Dependencies).
- Active Guardrails content was dissolved into the categorized lessons (each guardrail traces back to a specific lesson entry).
- Created `ITERATION_LOG.md` as the new temporal journal.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with the memory & continuous learning workflow.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` Lessons Loop section to reference both files.
**Outcome:** Success. All prior knowledge preserved, system simplified from 3 sections (buffer/log/reflector) to 2 files with clearer roles.
**Insight:** The old observational-memory format was powerful but required agents to understand a complex 3-phase cycle. The two-file split (curated vs. raw) achieves the same signal/noise separation with less cognitive overhead.
**Promoted to Lessons Learned:** No (process change, not a reusable technical insight)
